#Restaurant Website

HTML Structure:

Header: Contains navigation links (Home, Menu, About, Contact, and a cart link).

Swiper (Image Slider): Displays images in a carousel format with navigation buttons.

Menu Section: Displays the menu items, with images, names, prices, and a button to add items to the cart.

About Section: Describes the restaurant, menu offerings, chefs, and event services.

Contact Section: A contact form for users to inquire about special events.

Footer: Includes quick links, restaurant information, and contact details.

CSS Styling:

The design is centered on a responsive layout with a focus on simplicity and user-friendliness.
The swiper class handles the image slider with a fixed height and width.
The menu is displayed in a grid format, with each item presented in a card-like structure.
The about section is divided into four cards, each containing information and images about the restaurant.
The contact section includes a form styled with input fields and a submit button.

JavaScript Functionality:

Swiper Initialization: The Swiper is initialized with autoplay, looping, and navigation features.

Menu Rendering: Menu items are dynamically created using JavaScript, pulling data from the menuItems array and appending them to the menu section.

Interactivity: Buttons and links are styled to provide a good user experience, though some elements like the cart button and order button are set to display as none, possibly for future implementation or toggling.

Enhancements & Suggestions:

Mobile Responsiveness: Ensure that the layout adjusts well on smaller screens. Consider using media queries to enhance responsiveness.
Interactivity: Implement cart functionality where users can add items, and the cart updates dynamically.
Accessibility: Include alt attributes for images and consider improving color contrast for better readability.
Form Validation: Add client-side form validation to ensure proper input in the contact form.
